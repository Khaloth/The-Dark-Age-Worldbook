Idea: The books names' are the stages of life of a man:<br>
Book 1: <i><b>The Book of Dawn</b></i> which describes the creation of the first Men and of the gods and the cosmos.<br>
Book 2: <i><b>The Book of Hearth</b></i>, which describes the life and struggles of Men in Werheim.<br>
Book 3: <i><b>The Book of Banishment</b></i> which describes the banishment of Men from Werheim and their settlement in Faerun.<br>
Book 4: <i><b>The Book of Crowning</b></i>, which contains the ascention of Men to the role of the rulers of the Known World<br>
Book 5: <i><b>The Book of Dust</b></i>, which contains prophecies regarding the Men's future and the end of the world.
</p>

<h2>The Book of Dawn</h2>

<br>

<h4>Chapter I: The Birthtide</h4>

<pre>
The End of Days was come. That which had been of old-time was not and that which was to be of the Morrow would be not.
Heavens' woe, all had perished under the Serpent's wings.
On the first day the Serpent's Ghost moved o'er Men's burghs and dwellings, and under the storm of His wings stone stayed not on stone and crumbled into dust. Shelterless and without Temple Men as beasts wailed and hungered, night one.
At dawn of the second day, the Serpent's Head rose as the Sun and with His evil-eye he gazed at the Beasts of the Earth and unmade them so the flesh stuck not to bones and bones were as ash.
</pre>

<br>

<p>
{The idea here is to do 'inverse genesis' the serpent grows as he unmakes the world; he will kill the gods last.}
</p>

<br>

<p>
Upon the Endtide was the Time of Birth. There was Good &amp; there was Evil, there was Law &amp; there was Lawlessness; &amp; there was Struggle amongst All that was.<br>
The Warm and the Wild was the Flame, while the Cold and the Still was the Bane, and from their waters the Faces twain of Godhead begotten were: <a href="..\..\Religion\Elderlief\Wodarr.html" title="Wodarr" class="page">Wodarr</a> and <a href="..\..\Religion\Elderlief\Locken.html" title="Locken" class="page">Locken</a>.<br>
[By 'warm', 'cold', 'wild' and 'still' respectively are poetic names for 'good', 'evil', 'chaotic', 'lawful'.]
</p>

<p>
Two Brothers Almighty evermore <br>
Brought anew into this World their Glory were in the Image of what had once been afore the Eternity had all such things swallowed.<br>
Spawn of the Primordial Waters, the World of the Lords, by the Lords, for the Lords and their most sovereign Dominion was
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>The Book of Hearth</h2>

<p>
<b>Meaning:</b> No man may learn his own fate.
</p>

<p>
In the dead of neverending winter of the Northern Wereheim, a babe hight Mannig was born. His mother was a wretched wench, bereft of House and Husband and at the mercy of the Cruel Winterqueen Auril. Clinching the babe in her arms, she sank in the snow of the all-spanning icefields and wept. Her woeful cries were so loud and so heart-wrenching, they moved the meek Hearthmother Chauntea and she transformed the weeping mother into a large willow; but the mother was affrighted lest her son freeze should she unhand him. It was so then her wooden body swallowed the child.
</p>

<p>
The boy's body grew over the years, sustained on his mother's mucky resin, until he at last was become too large for his mother's loving encasement and he by virtue of his manly strength broke free through the wood and bark, and he crawled out onto the icy ground. So awonder was he by the strange, wider world he was blind to see his wounded mother, a woman once more, lay dying in the blood-molten snow with a riven belly.
</p>

<p>
He trodded naked as the Gods had made him through the winterlands until finally terror replaced wonder and pangs of pain replaced the thrills of unfettering and he returned unto the place whence he had departed only to find his dead forlorn mother lying in a ring of bloodstained frozen grass.
</p>

<p>
Never having lived in the World governed by the Lords' Law he understood not his mother's deathly state. He saw she was as he but unlike. As he had four limbs so she did; same with the head, the neck, and the feet. But her hands were smaller and more slender than his own. There was no black hair upon her face, and her body was somehow more calling to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
A black Crow, a harbinger of the Skullenlord Myrkul, landed in the woman's blood and drank it. It cawed thrice before croaking in answer to Mannig A woman is she who lieth there before thee, youthful man, for a Man thou art, which is why she looketh like and unlike thee, O, so.
</p>

<p>
Mannig looked at the Crow and puzzled he asked And why moveth she not as thou or I, Bird of the Night?<br>
And the bird answered That is so because thou art living and is not, for thy Mother is dead.
</p>

<p>
What meanst thou by that Dead, Bird? What is in that Dead that compels thy beak forge a smile O so cruel? What is in that Dead that makes me, a Living Man, so sorrowed and fearful and woebegone?<br>
And bird answered Thou art fearful for in that Dead the Depth and the Blackness of the Void is contained. Thou art fearful for in that Dead nothing is but the Judgement of the Lords which knoweth neither pity nor forbearance. Thy mother is forsooth Dead; she had once been as art thou, she shalt be so nevermore. She shalt never again take a breath nor speak a word. She shalt never again show thee wrath nor love. For dead Men are dead.
</p>

<p>
And Mannig wept at the Crow's words for too cruel seemed them to him though he understood them not. Griefstricken he cast a stone at the Black Bird and he slew him. The bird was Dead, and Mannig understood.
</p>

<p>
And Mannig roamed the Witerlands nude and abandoned. His heart harboured no Wonder nor Thrill of Unfettering. For in his heart was reduced to a chestnut under the great-terrible Weight of that Dead.
</p>

<p>
Mannig slept under no roof; and he ate no fruit; and he sang no song until the slain crow's brethren found his cold body in the snow, and they feasted upon his fearful heart.
</p>

<h2>The Book of Dawn</h2>

<p>
What great quaking, what awesome wrecking, shall there be on that day, the Day of Deeming, the Dusk of Being, the Night of Seeing! When mouths become dumb ash and limbs lie as bones on the grassless earth! When the sea doth overflow and flood and quash beneath her black waters the Lands of All, but the Giants, races. S For the giants alone shall brave
