<h2>Iron Dawn's Headquarters</h2>

<br>

<h3>Woodland</h3>

<p>
The Heroes return from their mission near the Drachenrock Mountains back to the <a href="..\..\Organisations\The_Iron_Dawn.html" title="Iron Dawn's" class="page">Iron Dawn's</a> headquarters in the depths of Kingholt. They have stayed at the headquarters' for a few weeks, waiting for the situation in Kingslandshire to cool down, but without much luck. The Way have made it their priority to hunt the four of them down and sent out large raiding- and scouting-parties to find and eliminate them. The fact that the Party directly enabled the Iron Dawn to destroy the Way's primary source of income did not help.
</p>

<p>
A few days ago, the party had been visited in a dream by Old <a href="..\..\Characters\Mages\Argger.html" title="Argger" class="page">Argger</a> and he foretold that on this very day, they would be summoned before Bulghuur and would be given a new task of critical importance to the defeat of the Witchqueens.
</p>

<p>
Aags, worried and anxious, starts a conversation about <i>why</i> they have been left to live this long, considering the <a href="..\..\Organisations\Way.html" title="Way" class="page">Way</a> knows their every move possibly even before they do. He promises to bring up the matter with <a href="..\..\Characters\Balghuur.html" title="Balghur" class="page">Balghur</a> after their return.
</p>

<p>
Aags also admits that reading from the Liber Gnaritatem Prohibitem has started to affect him. He admits that he has mostly stopped dreaming altogether and when he does dream, his mind is filled with incoherent whisperings and flashing images he does not understand. If he is let to speak, he further admits the book speaks to him in the dark. He resists any attempt to have the book taken from him and uses force if necessary.
</p>

<p>
At this point, the party is called on by a bullman to come inside. Old Argger's foretelling was right, Balghuur wanted to speak with them.
</p>

<h3>Executionchamber</h3>

<p>
A crowd of men is gathered round a bound woman dressed in rags. Her face is wet with sobbing and her voice is rasping.
</p>

<p>
Her crime is having agreed to house a group of pathfinders at her holding in the woods. Following her father's death, and having conceived with a child out of wedlock, she had no means of income, and as such, the pathfinders' offer seemed to her a blessing.
</p>

<p>
She is viciously mocked and openly told she was to die. While pleading for her life, she mentions her baby-boy and that what she had done for for his sake only.
</p>

<p>
After she is beheaded (or the conflict otherwise resolved), one of the cultists asks Balghur about what was to be done with her child, who apparently had been left alone in her steading. 'Kill it,' Balghur contemptuously retorts.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving, he says to the party 'A word,' asking them to come to the throne-room. Before the party enters, they are stopped by Snirr.
</p>

<p>
He praises them for having succeeded in their mission and explains to them that they were not the first who had been tasked with it. He tells them of the previous attempt some three- or fourscore years ago.
</p>

<p>
<i><b><tt>Snirr:</tt></b></i> <i><tt>Ye're not the first, brethren. Ye are the first to have come back. Why have ye come back? . . . from all the rest, fierce, brutal warriors blest by the very Great Horned One, some full-transformed. All dead. More that dead. Butchered. Slaughtered like pigs. The Queen-whore Æstra even bade her undead horde to hang their guts and flayed skin about in the branches of the trees all over Kingholt. Why have ye then come back? Are ye fiercer, more brutal than all those men gone before you? Are the blessings bestowed down on you by the Great Horned One mightier than all those Holy Brothers gone before you? Nay, it cannot be. Ye are weakling unbelievers. Ye have not studied the way of the labyrinthine heart. Ye kill no sacrifice for the Great Horned One. Ye have not raped nor pillaged the townsfolk-weaklings even once. Why, then, are ye come back here?</tt></i>
</p>

<p>
The group eventually enters through the large oaken, studded door, leading into Balghuur's dimly lit office. Immediately, they can sense something is off.
</p>

<h3>Balghuur's Office</h3>

<p>
<tt>When ye enter Balghur's office, ye are met with an overpowering smell of incense and freshly-spilled blood. Forsooth, once your eyes adopt to the darkness, they can see a slaughtered baby-boy lying limply on the stone-cut table in the middle of the room.</tt><br>
<tt>His face, throat, and boyhood have been devoured and his belly cut open, his guts spread in an ornamental spirals about the body. The killing was savage and at the same time, as betrayed the ornamental ordering of the guts and limbs, ritual and sophisticated.</tt>
</p>

<p>
Balghuur standing over the baby-boy, there is blood dripping from lips, tickling down his beard. He is surprised to be disturbed but his initial rage is quickly overcome and he welcomes the Heroes.
</p>

<p>
He commends them for their achievement and stresses that they had gone on a mission thwarted many times before. He enquires into the details of their journey and shows special interest in dominant constellation on the night of the cave's storming, the shape of the moon, the voices in the wind and so forth.
</p>

<p>
He soon concludes that it was by means of no blessing the Heroes have completed the mission but because Mother Jarga allowed them to. Aags asks why had they been left to live for this long and how does the Iron Dawn protect itself from the Mother Jarga's scrying.
</p>

<p>
He explains to the heroes the only reason why their resistence has not been squashed years ago is that they are permitted to exist and continue to put up a fight against the Way by none other than Mother Jarga. He goes on to tell the Party that she has no perception of loyalty whatever and changes sides on a whim.
</p>

<p>
He tells of them of a particular incident during which she almost commanded the Iron Dawn to lay an ambush for her own men and watched them being slaughtered by Balghur's companions. She is nevertheless too powerful an ally to lose by the Way - she is even one of the four founding sorcereresses - and most of the time she works against the Iron Dawn.
</p>

<p>
Balghur thinks Mother Jarga has chosen her new champions. She had done so before. Her reasons for doing so are a closely kept secret. In Balghur's lifetime, this has happened only once before when he was quite young, he had heard from Father Morgan, however, that Mother Jarga has been doing so for centuries, perhaps millenia.
</p>

<p>
She selects heroes of humble means and watches their growth. She guides them and pulls the strings in the world around them. In the end, she ensures their fall.
</p>

<p>
<i><b><tt>Balghuur:</tt></b><tt> Invariably she watched her Chosen Ones grow. Under her unseen guidance, they braved danger, climbed mountains, descended whither no mortal man had dared descend and, eventually, they rose among the exalted. They rose and they fell. They had moments of glory and of defeat. Nevertheless, they never, in the end, failed to conquer. And when their deeds were greatest, their exaltations loudest, their reputation amongst men like that of living-gods, they fell for the last time. And what a fall they had. Some went mad and died as raving lepers; some developed uncontrollable unnatural lusts that got them eventually burnt at the stake. Some turned on their companions, slaughtered the whole company, and fled ne'er to be seen again.</tt></i>
</p>

<p>
Eventually Balghuur presents the party a torn banner bearing the sigil of the Noble House Bockenzander. He explains <a href="..\..\Characters\Borren.html" title="Borren" class="page">Borren</a>, <a href="..\..\Characters\Snirr.html" title="Snirr" class="page">Snirr</a>, <a href="..\..\Characters\Thing.html" title="Thing" class="page">Thing</a>, <a href="..\..\Characters\Wendur.html" title="Wendur" class="page">Wendur</a> had found a similar one in the goldmint and details the mission and stresses its success. He expresses his concern the Way has found itself a noble sponsor. He tasks the party with finding out what precisely is the connexion between the noble house and the Way and report back to him. He tells them he's arranged for a caravan to take them to Crystalthorp the next morning from Waterdeep.
</p>

<p>
Before the party departs Balghuur tells them to pick up 50 drachens and some supplies. He gives Aags the <i>Knock</i> spell. He tells them to Lodge at <a href="..\..\Characters\Will_of_Crystalthorpe.html" title="Will's" class="page">Will's</a> house in Crystalthorpe.<br>
Balghuur mentions the <b><u>caravan-fee has been paid for.</u></b>
