<h1>Synopsis</h1>

<p>
House <a href="..\History\Houses\Bockenzander.html" title="Bockenzander" class="page">Bockenzander</a> was a proud and mighty house standing strong through centuries. Alas, hard times have befallen it. Brunnhilde of House Thorne had dreamt of the might and riches of the Bockenzanders since she was engaged to be married to the eldest son of the Lord Erwin Bockenzander - the fiersome Erik Bockenzander. Proud, strong and uncompromising, he would be a perfect match for the young Brunnhilde, an equal in ambition and unscrupulousness. None of this, however, came to pass.
</p>

<p>
Erik was tragically killed during the annual Summerstrife Joast and the grieving Brunhilde was to settle for his younger brother Dunn.
</p>

<p>
Beshaba and Myrkul laughed when Dunn was gored by the boar he was hunting in his bride-to-be's honour.
</p>

<p>
Before the arrangement of marriage to the third eldest son, Leif, could even be made, the young prince was called on by his Gods and fled the kingdom to become a hermit.
</p>

<p>
It was so that a fourth and final arrangement was made and Gunnhild was not happy about it. In the end, she had to settle for the youngest and weakest brother of the four: the young Fyllior who had never wished nor expected to sit on the throne of Crystalthorpe, let alone expand its power and influence.
</p>

<p>
The wedding proceded as planned  and Brunhilde bore the Bockenzander House a healthy boy Felldor. She, however, was not happy. Her husband was squandering the great wealth he had inherited and the long-lasting reputation of his fathers of stern and just rulership was soon ground to dust.
</p>

<p>
This was not the life she had imagined. Wherever she went, people seemed to snigger behind her back. Soon the endless tide of pointless spending, bad investment, and overall financial neglect left the house indebted and the noble coffers depleted. It was at this time that Brunhilde received a letter from Valindra wherein the authoress seemed to sympathise with the disheartened lady and offered her a way out of her predicament.
</p>

<p>
Brunnhilde would aid her smuggle weaponry and alchemical supplies into all the cities whereto House Bockenzander delivered glass, which at the time was most of the realm in exchange for vast sums of gold.
</p>

<p>
Brunnhilde took up on this offer and soon the lordly coffers began filling up again. Lord Fyllior noticed his wife's sudden interest in the House's business and at first scolded her for meddling in the realm of menfolk, but ultimately did not care to stop her, especially with her seeming great success.
</p>

<p>
The reason for the smuggling-operation was the Way was arming the Sons of the Wyrmslayer in preparation for a nationwide racial uprising during which they hoped to instigate such bloodshed the promised thousand souls would become an achievable goal. The present leader of the Sons of the Wyrmslayer is in the area because he is to meet Valindra to receive her blessing to initiate this uprising.
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting he does not know her by her real name nor purpose. Valindra is planning to come into the area towards the end of the chapter to place one last great order to smuggle wildfire into every city in the North. Valindra is planning to kill Brunhilde during this meeting and assume her place in disguise. She will then order all the glass be destroyed and replaced with flasks of wildfire before sending them out all across the North.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Valindra had long persuaded Brunnhilde to give her husband up. Valindra suggested her husband have an `accident' in the woods while hunting but never specified. Brunnhilde thought they would make him die in a hunting-accident and even sent a letter with her servant-boy, whom she had groomed to spy on Lord Fyllior on her behalf, instructing him what to do after her husband's death.
</p>

<p>
Instead Valindra's servants slaughtered the Lord's entire hunting-party and turned him into a <b>Preystalker</b> (a higher form of a gatherer). Brunnhilde knows nothing of this and is truly clueless regarding her husband's death. Fearing the discovery of the letter she had sent with her spy, she never called for a search and tried to excuse her husband's absence however she could. She cannot admit he was lost during the hunt because she is afraid the implicating letter she had sent out will be found.
</p>

<p>
A few days after the Party's arrival, Lord Ordrin Roaringthorn comes to visit Lord Fyllior, his childhood friend, and is becoming increasingly impatient with Lady Brunnhilde's excuses. He is threatening her with taking the matter to the King who is to become his brother-in-law following the planned wedding of his daughter to Alarick Aldersang, the Duke of Norrimguard.
</p>

<p>
Worthy of remark, this decision of the King's has been widely unpopular for the ruling house of Amphail is wholly new and does not have the respect that naturally comes to the elderhouses. The King is not concerned with this as he is already unpopular following the dissolution of Greater Ashenwyrm.
</p>

<p>
At the same time the Sons of the Wyrmslayer are restless, awaiting the grand event.
</p>

<p>
While all this is happening, there is a serial killer stalking the woods at night attacking innocent women and children. Sometimes even slaughtering entire households if the steading is remote. The killer is man who witnessed his wife raped and killed and his twelve children eaten by the Orks during the War and does the exact same thing to his victims, recreating the traumatic event and plunging further into madness.
</p>

<p>
He is the only eyewitness of Lord Fyllior's abduction and the slaying of his hunting-party. In exchange for his life after he is dicovered, he offers to take the Party to the place of the incident where the incriminating letter may be found on the rotting body of the lady's spy.
</p>

<p>
This provides the Party with enough evidence to take Lady Brunnhilde before Kingstead, the highest court in the land. For this purpose they will first need to find a human man to represent them for none of them qualifies to stand before the court due to either their race or sex.
</p>

<p>
Valindra will do everything and anything in her power to prevent this, having been warned by Mother Jarga at the very last moment. The party will be attacked very publicly by the transformed Lord Fyllior. If they defeat him, his identity will become known. The Way will have gone too far. Having taken life of a well-standing nobleman will take the threat of the gatherers all the way to the King who shall pledge to take care of the matters personally, and the Party will aid him in this matter.
</p>

<h1>Subchapters</h1>

<br>

<h2>Interlude</h2>

<p>
Borren, Snirr, Thing, and Wendur are tasked with attacking the Way's chief goldmint, their primary source of income. Similarly, several other cells are attacked at the same time with overwhelming success, crippling the Way's finances and forcing them to act prematurely on their plans lest their coffers run dry.
</p>

<p>
- Update: The mission was a roaring success. The Way has been cut off from their primary source of income as well as their main communication tool with the Elder Lords
</p>

<h2>Balghuur's Concern</h2>

<p>
More details <a href="./Chapter_5/Subchapter_1,_Balghuur's_Concern.html" title="here" class="page">here</a>. Following a brief show of the cult's brutality, the party is summoned before Balghuur for a new mission. He informs them of Borren's party's success but expresses concern regarding the noble banners found in the raided goldmint. He worries the Way has got itself a noble sponsor. Wishing to cut the Way's finances wholly off, he orders the party to go and investigate the matter. If it were so, the consequences for the noble house would be dire.
</p>

<h2>The Whore, the Whoreson, &amp; the Elf</h2>

<p>
More details <a href="./Chapter_5/Subchapter_2,_The_Whore,_the_Whoreson,_&_the_Elf.html" title="here" class="page">here</a>. The Party prepares itself for departure. At the tavern, Malbor is lured out by a succubus by saved by the party. Scorch is killed during the struggle. The next day the party departed for Crystalthorp with the Black Swan's company led by Swen. The Black Swans are lured out by the sight of a corpse up the road and taken by one by, only Swen surviving. The party is dragged out by the elves and ordered to kill Old Lizzie to prove their loyalty to her. Malbor does so and Heln swears revenge.<br>
Heln is released into the woodland and told to inform the townsmen of Crystalthorp what had occurred. He is killed on the way by Darkeye Peter. His head is displayed in his lair.
</p>

<h2>Welcome to Crystalthorp</h2>

<p>
More details <a href="./Chapter_5/Subchapter_3,_Welcome_to_Crystalthorp.html" title="here" class="page">here</a>. The party is welcomed at the Willstead. The next day, they are approached by Sir Hawk who asks them to investigate the local Freyshrine. Should they succeed, they are promised a generous finnancial reward as well as a dinner at Sir Hawk's mansion. They get familiar with the mill incident and the residents of Lakefield. They learn Sir Swen is still alive and get assaulted on their way to the shrine. Once there, they unravel the mystery and return to Sir Hawk. 
</p>

<h2>The Freyshrine</h2>

<p>
The Party found the shrine overrun with unnatural darkness. A portal to Shadowfell had been opened there as a consequence of the Way's dealings with the powers of nature. They found the ghosts of <a href="..\Characters\Rodwin_Walbertson.html" title="Rodwin" class="page">Rodwin</a> and <a href="..\Characters\Walbert_the_Priest_of_Frey.html" title="Walbert" class="page">Walbert</a> (the priest and his son) who informed them they had been killed by shadowhounds. The Party's initial attempt at the cleansing of the shrine was unsuccessful and they fled as dark tentacles lashed out from the portal-door overcome with shadowy all-devouring moss. They returned the next day to finish what they had started. Malbor was nearly devoured by the portal, but eventually they closed the gate into Shadowfell.
</p>

<p>
Thereafter, they returned to Lakefield. In the dead of night, Malbor, who was not sleeping, could hear footfalls approaching the house. He raised the alarm and the unknown figure fled, killing a cat on his way out. It was <a href="..\Characters\Darkeye_Peter.html" title="Darkeye Peter" class="page">Darkeye Peter</a> on his hunt for another victim. He diverted his course in search of an easier victim. He fled across the fields and killed a farmers family instead.
</p>

<h2>Creme de la Creme</h2>

<p>
More details <a href="./Chapter_5/Subchapter_4,_Creme-de-la-Creme.html" title="here" class="page">here</a>. The party The party arrives at Sir Hawk's residence. They encounter his erratic wife and the rest of his household. Left alone for brief moment in the drawing-room, they learn about the tensions between Sir Hawk and Lady Gunnhilde as well as learning closer information about the problems plaguing the City. During dinner Sir Hawk approaches the subject of Lord Bockenzander being absent and his worries. While snooping around his house, they learn of his troubles with Gunnhild Bockenzander as well as the underway reparations and a request for the increase of the supply of stone from the <b>Greystone Quarry.</b>
</p>

<h2>The Growing Horror</h2>

<p>
There is a great commotion back at Lakefield. Darkeye Peter's doings have been discovered and Will realises what might have happened to his family. He pleads with the Adventurers to rid them of the Beast.
