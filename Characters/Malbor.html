<p>
<b>Tiara</b> was finally about to bring Malbor to the world. Her childbirth had been complicated from the start. She was struggling to push, having drained all her energy carrying the child inside her for months. <b>Faelar</b>, the Hierophant of the druidic circle of Lurkwood (More info in appendix point 1), <b>was holding Tiara’s hand in her final moments of life</b>. He knew she would not make it and there was an even lesser chance of her offspring to live. She pushed and pushed with her last moments of breath until he saw it; the child’s head was visible. By the power and magick bestowed upon him, he tried to keep her alive just a bit longer. He wanted to give her child a chance at the wonders of life. With each forceful push, she screamed louder but eventually, the baby was right there in front of his gleaming blue eyes. The little one started to cry after a short while and a smile was visible on the face of the soothsayer. “Take care of him for me, I beg thee.” were the final words uttered by his mother. Shortly after, she passed away. Tears rolled down Faelar’s cheeks as he grieved for the loss of his student. He promised her he would protect the child as if he were his own.
</p>

<p>
Years passed from that event and Malbor had grown into a strong and agile lad, having been present in the world for fourteen winters. Faelar spent many of those years training the boy in the arts of the druids he belonged to, away from prying eyes. None of his fellow seers approved of the young elf as his mother was just a student and didn’t complete her training to become a full-fledged member of the circle. If it were up to them, he would be cast out (More info in appendix point 2), but Faelar had other intentions. The child had not known any father figure but his mentor (More info in appendix point 3). As the boy became a man, he realized he would never be accepted as one of them. It didn’t matter to their leader (More info in appendix point 4); a promise was made to the boy’s mother he would take care of the young one and by any means necessary, he would keep said promise.
</p>

<p>
By the age of twenty-seven, the one who was once a boy had now become a man. His acrobatic skills were only matched by a few, having spent a lot of his life climbing trees and traversing the environment. He grew a certain fondness towards the animals in the forest, befriending them as he went along. A certain connection was present between the wood elf and the wildlife roaming Lurkwood. Faelar wanted him to continue in the studies of the druids and become one of them, but Malbor had little interest in such stuff; he believed that his true calling was to become a guardian of this forest. The two disbanded shortly after, in good faith they would meet again someday. The lad left the teachings of his master to fight for something greater in his life. He wanted to explore the forest and one day, to explore the whole continent. The Hierophant knew he could not keep him against his own free will, so, he asked Malbor to be especially careful as the world was teeming with evil just waiting to take a piece of him. The protector promised him he would do his best to be careful and more
