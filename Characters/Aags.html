Description
</p>

<p>
Aags is a small creature, barely over 3'5" and brittle of stature. His naked body is covered in ancient grime, sores, and significant scarring the worst of which marks his back — the product of a brutal whipping he suffered as a boy at the hands of the lasher-children. Just like his father, he is completely bald and possesses only meagre black bodyhair.
</p>

<p>
His clothing is tattered yet strangely well-kept; it mostly consists of various items of clothing he stole off corpses and clumsily refitted for himself. It has endured the scorns of time only with the extensive help of a sewing needle and patching-fabric.
</p>

<p>
Aags's face is oval and his nose long and pointy almost to parody. His eyes are a toxic yellow colour and faintly glow in the dark.
</p>

<p>
Backstory
</p>

<p>
Birth
</p>

<p>
Aags was born during a frigid blizzard of Hungerswathe 1362 DR, to a gatherer-caste goblette of clan Mekrod, or Sword-House, under the sign of the Serpent.
</p>

<p>
Goblins lead quick and promiscuous lives and, therefore, it is uncommon for them to know their fathers; Aags, however, born bald with Xheg of the Lashers being the only bald tribesman, could be well certain of his progenitor. Aags and Xheg became very close during Aags's boyhood — a bond which has never flagged of faltered.
</p>

<p>
Like every other goblin born under the sign of the Serpent, Aags was singled out along with his twinbrother Mokmassog to be educated by the tribe's shaman Grath in magick and become one of the greatest assets of Clan Mekrod which granted him a privileged position which his physical shortcomings would otherwise have wholly prevented from attaining.
</p>

<p>
Bullies
</p>

<p>
Aags's was, nevertheless, full of hardship and suffered cruelties, petty and gross, at the hands of his fellows. During one particular incident, he got into a fight with a bully named Vogg when they discovered both of them were swiving Aags's sister Leff.
</p>

<p>
Aags drowned Vogg in the near stream with a paddle. When Vogg's friends found out, they overpowered and restrained Aags and whipped his back bloody with lashes till they had to take breaks for their hands to rest. Shaman Grath, intervened, and prevented the boys from killing Aags.
</p>

<p>
Spellbook, &amp; Acquaintance with Commontongue &amp; Men's Culture
</p>

<p>
Aags had always been Grath's favourite pupil and showed great prowess in the matters of the arcane. His fondness grew so much he even gave Aags access to the clan's spellbook — an heirloom passed from shaman to shaman.
</p>

<p>
Being written in Commontongue, Aags's previous superficial education in the language proved insufficient, and he spent much time conversing with the handful of human slaves Clan Mekrod had amassed; in exchange for additional food, water and other odds and ends, he made them teach him the language and, over time, he became proficient.
</p>

<p>
During their conversations, the slaves taught him about the world of men; its kings, heroes, histories, and so forth. Aags became enamoured with this imagined world of grandiose castles, knights in shining armour and conniving, yet respected magicians.
</p>

<p>
Rite of Passage &amp; Leff's Death
</p>

<p>
The first deep blow Fate delivered to Aags was the death of his sister in 1366 on the day of his rite of passage, being given the name Aags — replacing his boyname of Shlabog — the Weakling. She died in childbirth. Whether the baby-boy was Aags's son or not is not known, but he did not survive the night.
</p>

<p>
Godswar
</p>

<p>
The North was at war and Clan Mekrod exploited the chaos of the period to raid the camps of both Men and Orcs, both being the goblins' perennial foes. Yet, through a sudden diplomatic shift between the Goblins' Gods Maglubiyet and Khurgobaeyag and the Orcish Pantheon, the clan found itself mobilised to fight on Orcs' side by spring of 1367.
</p>

<p>
Aags detested the alliance and curst Shaman Grath as an old fool for making his family side with the green beasts. All the more, he hated large-scale slaughter and the destruction of the grandiose castles he idolised.
</p>

<p>
Xheg's Murder &amp; Dishonourable Departure
</p>

<p>
Under immense pressure following his father's departure for a hobgoblin camp nicknamed Slaughterhouse on the Glade at the Shaman Xheg's order and acting upon the whispers the clan was to partake in the siege of Silverflowburg in Fireheartshire, he terrible argument broke out between the master and his foremost student.
</p>

<p>
Xheg labelled Aags a traitor and demoted to the caste of Pariah, the lowest-of-the-low. His teeth would be smashed out of his mouth, rendering him magickally impotent and he'd be left to be preyed upon by everybody else. All his privileges of the Serpentborn and a son of a lasher would stripped off him.
</p>

<p>
Instead, Aags smashed Xheg's skull open with a stone and bit the flesh off the shaman's neck with his bare fangs. Hastily, Aags pocketed the clan's spellbook and persuaded his dimwitted brother Mokmassog to leave with him before daybreak.
</p>

<p>
Seventown
</p>

<p>
They roamed the wilderness until 1371, settling in the forests of Seventown. Being ensnared and caught by a local band of adventurers, they were thrown into the city dungeon to be drawn and quartered for public entertainment at nearest holiday.
</p>

<p>
The two escaped with the dwarf Vaerus and goodwoman Annabelle, before splitting off to retrieve Aags's spellbook. Mokmassog would suffer a mortal wound on their way to ground-level and Aags would bury him in the Seventown cemetery before being confronted by Vaerus. For reasons known only to the dwarf, he charged the goblin and Aags killed him with a blast-spell.
</p>
