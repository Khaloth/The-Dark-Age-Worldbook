Created Monday 12 September 2022
</p>

<p>
Wendur was born as the eldest of eight boys into a poor family of travelling-sellswords hight The Sullen Men. He has no sisters as newborn girls were abandoned and left for dead upon birth by the order of his father. There was no room for weakness among The Sullen Men, and no one who could not contribute to the trade was to expect anything from the family.
</p>

<p>
During Wendur's fifteenth winter, his brother Ellmack, got stranded in a snowstorm in the woods until the early hours of the morning. He soon developed a fever and frequently fell in and out of consciousness. After battling the disease for a month Ellmack survived but started suffering from shortness of breath and dizziness during his everyday tasks.
</p>

<p>
After two months, his condition did not better and it became clear the lung-damage was permanent. His father, following this realisation, suddenly ordered the family began a march a hundred miles southward without giving any reason and sold Ellmack's horse for `travel expenses'.
</p>

<p>
Wendur's brother held out valiantly, marching on and doing his best to keep up with his mounted kinsmen but alas his health, in the end, gave in. About three-quarter-way into the first day's march he became breathless and collapsed onto his knees, vainly gasping for air. Wendur shouted to his father but was promptly ignored.
</p>

<p>
He begged him to stop the march, or at least to allow him and his brother to switch places but his pleas fell on deaf years. But his father's true wrath remained hidden until Wendur turned his steed to gallop toward Ellmack.
</p>

<p>
His father stopped his horse and shot his crossbow at Wendur, narrowly missing his son's neck. He threatened to kill him should he make one more step towards Ellmack who by this time had collapsed into the mud, grappled by a violent seizure.
</p>

<p>
It was thus that his brother was left to die, lonely and abandoned in the cold mountains of Northern Swordcoast.
</p>

<p>
When the continent was ravaged by the orkish hordes during Godswar, The Sullen Men were hired by generals of the increasingly desperate King Ballendor Aldersang to aid his armies fight off the greenskin hordes.
</p>

<p>
Wendur fought beside his father and all four of his living brothers in the Last Battle of Great Ashenwyrm\footnote{King Ballendor was killed in this battle and the Great Ashenwyrm was broken up into the kingdoms of Ashenwyrm, Loridia, and Delimbyr in the aftermath}. During the battle, his father was assaulted by two ork axemen and knocked to the ground, his spear rolling away on the bloodstained ground.
</p>

<p>
His father reached for the spear to block the oncoming axe-blow but Wendur standing over him, who had vowed never to forgive his father for Ellmack's death, kicked the spear away. The last thing his father saw before the ork's axe cleft his skull in two was Wendur's grim, half-mad smile.
</p>

<p>
As the battle raged on, Wendur was eventually overpowered by a different greenskin and nearly beaten to death with the ork's bare hands. His injuries were so severe he was thought dead even by the winning Men's army after the battle and buried with the dead in a shallow mass-grave.
</p>

<p>
Wendur believes it was at this time, dreaming amongst a thousand dead that Lord Baphomet himself entered his dreamless sleep and ordered him to join the Iron Dawn. He gave him strength to cleave through the forty-thousand limbs of the fallen and to the surface. Following Lord Baphomet's instructions, Wendur travelled to Kingslandshire to join the Iron Dawn and serve him eternally. Since then, he has become one of the Horned One's Bloodhooves\footnote{A Bloodhoof is a priest of Baphomet, a wicked title held by the very few most capable and bloodthirsty of his followers.}.
</p>

<p>
The battle left its mark on Wendur and he only partially recovered. His bones had been shattered in so many places he is permanently disfigured. It is for this reason Wendur cannot stand straight as his spine is S-shaped from the front and his legs form a double-X.
