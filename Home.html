<h1>Story Summary</h1>

<br>

<h2>Volume 0</h2>

<p>
'Waelindera' — to become Valindra centuries later — a mighty sorceress joins forces with Sage Jafar Al-Azhred to destroy the <a href="./Organisations/Cult_of_the_Banished.html" title="Cult of the Banished" class="page">Cult of the Banished</a>.
</p>

<h2>Volume 1</h2>

<p>
The Annabelle, Dysbella, and Vaerus awoke in the basement-sex-dungeon of <a href="./Characters/Morack_Gnock_Glasseye.html" title="Morack Gnock Glasseye" class="page">Morack Gnock Glasseye</a> — a half-orc half-blood of the House of Fortune running an underground alchemical laboratory in the off-section of the dungeon for the House — beneath the Twisted Tusk Inn having been drugged the previous evening. They unhinged the celldoor and snuck out. The exit-door was locked so they set out to find the key. In their doing so, they encountered a group of hostile alchemists whom they were forced to slay, retreiving from their bodies the <b>Gaudium Solution</b>. They found their way out and confronted Morak who apologised, and promised them free bedding if they forget the incident, explaining he was running an illegal brothel underground. They accepted and slept the night. The next day they found a contract on killing a troll near Seventown which they accepted as they had run out of coin. They joined another adventuring group for the task who slew the beast with almost no help from the party for which they refused to share the money.
</p>

<p>
The party went to sleep once more. They found a slip of paper of scribbles next to the nightstand where they had the Gaudium Solution. They attempted to transcribe the page but could not, they only scribbled. Someone had tried to do just that before them — Glasseye. They also observed an etched cross on their door but thought little of it. At night, an assassin sent by the House of Fortune attempted their lives but was instead killed. The killer had been sent on behalf of the House of Fortune following Morack's disclosure of the Gaudium Solution being in the Party's possession. They found a reference to the Eighth House therein; the assassin was instructed to go to the Temple in Seventown to receive his payment.
</p>

<p>
The Party left the inn for the city which was under lockdown because of the Bellkiller — a serial murderer comissioned by the city itself (as it turned out) to keep the population scared and distracted from their embezzling corruption. The Party scaled the walls except for Vaerus who fell and knocked himself out in the bushes. The rest of the party traversed the city over rooftops, and accidentally entered a house with the bellkiller having freshly committed his murder and hiding in the closet. He sprang out yet the Party overpowered and killed him. Vaerus, having regained his consciousness, somehow entered the city through the gates after conversing with the guards.
</p>

<p>
The Party regrouped at the Temple and entered jointly. Inside, a lady — the wife of the Merchantlord of House of Merit, Mendacius, a house responsible for military duties and the circulation of the city newspaper — was awaiting the assassin and was shocked to see the adventurers. They confronted her, but she overpowered them with ease, displaying supernatural strength and ability, foreshadowing the disclosure of her identity as the sole survivor of the <a href="./Organisations/Midnight_Ring_Coven.html" title="Midnight Ring Coven" class="page">Midnight Ring Coven</a>. In the end, she had them taken away by the guards and thrown into the dungeons to be executed at a later date.
</p>

<p>
In prison, in the cell opposite, a pair of goblins Aags and Mokmasog, or Witzgudt and Fleshlots, were awaiting their own public execution-for-entertainment in the upcoming days. With joint effort, they broke free after tricking the guard and escaped. The goblins broke away from the group to reobtain Aags's spellbook which the gaolers had confiscated. The Party dropped through a grating in the floor onto a rotting pile of bodies in an underground chamber connecting with the sewers — amongst the dead was Morack Glasseye. A discarded letter was found on his person, addressed to his secret lover the bookmaker's wife explaining the House of Fortune would have him killed for his indiscretion and failure to protect the Gaudium Solution page.
</p>

<p>
Out of pity, the group set out to deliver the letter to the addressed woman. They spent the night in the sewers, for the first time experiencing a vision of Mother Jarga herself, who apparently had taken interest in the group. She instructed them to 'seek her out', showing them imagery of the tallest tower of the Seventown Castle. One member of the Party — Dysbella — fell sick and was left behind as little relationship had been developed between her and the group. She would die the next day.
</p>

<p>
The Party did as they agreed and delivered the letter. Morack's lover broke down upon receiving the news. After calming down she made an unusual request: she had aborted a foetus after growing heavy with the child of Morack's and, out of fear her husband would find out, buried the wretched thing in a shallow grave in a flowerbed. She requested the group take the foetus and give it proper burial and — if possible — do the same for Glasseye. The group agreed and after nightfall dug up the foetus. To their bewilderment, it was alive in undeath. It grew heavier than lead and jumped onto Vaerus, requesting it be carried to a burial place, lest the Party be consumed by it. 
</p>

<p>
Doing as requested, the Party soon brought the undead child to the Seventown graveyard. Once there, the demon got off Vaerus's back and grew limp and permitted itself be buried. After the deed, the group noted faint weeping in the distance. After a brief investigation, the found Aags, having freshly buried his twinbrother Mokmasog who died earlier during their own escape to freedom. Vaerus, suddenly enraged by the reunion, charged the goblin, who killed him with a blast-spell, smashing the dwarf's skull against a nearby mausoleum wall. Through an extraordinary restraint and show of diplomacy, he ended up joining the group shortly afterwards.
</p>

<p>
By this point the group's escape had become known and a reward had been announced for their heads. In particular, the head of Annabelle Mithridge or 'Scarface' as the city dubbed her. On their way back to the sewers where they had left Dysbella, the group accidentally walked into an execution-place a soon-to-become companion, the Barbarian Samoth. Taking pity on him, and in desperate need of loyal reinforcements for their cause of clearing their names and finding out the truth about the Gaudium, cut him off and fled the scene with him in a mad dash.
</p>

<p>
During their run, an old man who recognised them from the freshly put up Wanted posters waved to them and hid them in his house. He lived alone with his only daughter, with whom he was romantically involved. He revealed to the group the existence of an underground resistence-group of the Old Lord's loyalists, who despised the new oligarchical order imposed upon the city by the merchantlords after overthrowing and slaying the last lord Frederick.
</p>

<p>
The group after recouperating at their old sewer hiding-place, after clearing it from ghouls who had feasted upon Dysbella's dead body, sought out this group. They did a handful of jobs for them, including the procurement of arms. Eventually they found out the location of the second page of the Gaudium — the Lawkeep dungeons. They infiltrated the building and, braving extreme danger and even slaying a basilisk, they obtained the page.
</p>

<p>
After this victory, they were revisited by Mother Jarga who besought them to seek her out and promised answers; she instructs them on how to surpass a magickal barrier erected around her. The group did as she asked and entered the now-abandoned Seventown Castle. The ascended through the the old structure, at the cost of one of Annabelle's eyes. Fighting their way up, they finally stood before the final chamber and faced its guardians. Having been followed by the wife of Lord Mendacius, the disguised hag, she intervenes and aids them in the fight, seeing the group on friendly
</p>

<p>
With victory but a hand's reach away, they were apprehended on their way out by the city forces and returned back into the dungeons with much fanfare.
